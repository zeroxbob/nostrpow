## System Prompt Management

The AI assistant's behavior and knowledge is defined by the CONTEXT.md file, which serves as the system prompt. To modify the assistant's instructions or add new project-specific guidelines:

1. Edit CONTEXT.md directly
2. The changes take effect in the next session

## "Vibed with MKStack"

When building the site for the first time, include "Vibed with MKStack" somewhere in the UI, linked to this URL: https://soapbox.pub/mkstack

## Nostr Protocol Integration

This project comes with custom hooks for querying and publishing events on the Nostr network.

### Nostr Implementation Guidelines

- Always use the `nostr__read_nips_index` tool before implementing any Nostr features to see what kinds are currently in use across all NIPs.
- If any existing kind or NIP might offer the required functionality, use the `nostr__read_nip` tool to investigate thoroughly. Several NIPs may need to be read before making a decision.
- Only generate new kind numbers with the `nostr__generate_kind` tool if no existing suitable kinds are found after comprehensive research.

Knowing when to create a new kind versus reusing an existing kind requires careful judgement. Introducing new kinds means the project won't be interoperable with existing clients. But deviating too far from the schema of a particular kind can cause different interoperability issues.

#### Choosing Between Existing NIPs and Custom Kinds

When implementing features that could use existing NIPs, follow this decision framework:

1. **Thorough NIP Review**: Before considering a new kind, always perform a comprehensive review of existing NIPs and their associated kinds. Use the `nostr__read_nips_index` tool to get an overview, and then `nostr__read_nip` and `nostr__read_kind` to investigate any potentially relevant NIPs or kinds in detail. The goal is to find the closest existing solution.

2. **Prioritize Existing NIPs**: Always prefer extending or using existing NIPs over creating custom kinds, even if they require minor compromises in functionality.

3. **Interoperability vs. Perfect Fit**: Consider the trade-off between:
   - **Interoperability**: Using existing kinds means compatibility with other Nostr clients
   - **Perfect Schema**: Custom kinds allow perfect data modeling but create ecosystem fragmentation

4. **Extension Strategy**: When existing NIPs are close but not perfect:
   - Use the existing kind as the base
   - Add domain-specific tags for additional metadata
   - Document the extensions in `NIP.md`

5. **When to Generate Custom Kinds**:
   - No existing NIP covers the core functionality
   - The data structure is fundamentally different from existing patterns
   - The use case requires different storage characteristics (regular vs replaceable vs addressable)

6. **Custom Kind Publishing**: When publishing events with custom kinds generated by `nostr__generate_kind`, always include a NIP-31 "alt" tag with a human-readable description of the event's purpose.

**Example Decision Process**:
```
Need: Equipment marketplace for farmers
Options:
1. NIP-15 (Marketplace) - Too structured for peer-to-peer sales
2. NIP-99 (Classified Listings) - Good fit, can extend with farming tags
3. Custom kind - Perfect fit but no interoperability

Decision: Use NIP-99 + farming-specific tags for best balance
```

#### Tag Design Principles

When designing tags for Nostr events, follow these principles:

1. **Kind vs Tags Separation**:
   - **Kind** = Schema/structure (how the data is organized)
   - **Tags** = Semantics/categories (what the data represents)
   - Don't create different kinds for the same data structure

2. **Use Single-Letter Tags for Categories**:
   - **Relays only index single-letter tags** for efficient querying
   - Use `t` tags for categorization, not custom multi-letter tags
   - Multiple `t` tags allow items to belong to multiple categories

3. **Relay-Level Filtering**:
   - Design tags to enable efficient relay-level filtering with `#t: ["category"]`
   - Avoid client-side filtering when relay-level filtering is possible
   - Consider query patterns when designing tag structure

4. **Tag Examples**:
   ```json
   // ❌ Wrong: Multi-letter tag, not queryable at relay level
   ["product_type", "electronics"]

   // ✅ Correct: Single-letter tag, relay-indexed and queryable
   ["t", "electronics"]
   ["t", "smartphone"]
   ["t", "android"]
   ```

5. **Querying Best Practices**:
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Inefficient: Get all events, filter in JavaScript
   const events = await nostr.query([{ kinds: [30402] }]);
   const filtered = events.filter(e => hasTag(e, 'product_type', 'electronics'));

   // ✅ Efficient: Filter at relay level
   const events = await nostr.query([{ kinds: [30402], '#t': ['electronics'] }]);
   ```

#### `t` Tag Filtering for Community-Specific Content

For applications focused on a specific community or niche, you can use `t` tags to filter events for the target audience.

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Community apps: "farmers" → `t: "farming"`, "Poland" → `t: "poland"`
- ❌ Generic platforms: Twitter clones, general Nostr clients

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Publishing with community tag
createEvent({
  kind: 1,
  content: data.content,
  tags: [['t', 'farming']]
});

// Querying community content
const events = await nostr.query([{
  kinds: [1],
  '#t': ['farming'],
  limit: 20
}], { signal });
```

### Kind Ranges

An event's kind number determines the event's behavior and storage characteristics:

- **Regular Events** (1000 ≤ kind < 10000): Expected to be stored by relays permanently. Used for persistent content like notes, articles, etc.
- **Replaceable Events** (10000 ≤ kind < 20000): Only the latest event per pubkey+kind combination is stored. Used for profile metadata, contact lists, etc.
- **Addressable Events** (30000 ≤ kind < 40000): Identified by pubkey+kind+d-tag combination, only latest per combination is stored. Used for articles, long-form content, etc.

Kinds below 1000 are considered "legacy" kinds, and may have different storage characteristics based on their kind definition. For example, kind 1 is regular, while kind 3 is replaceable.

### Content Field Design Principles

When designing new event kinds, the `content` field should be used for semantically important data that doesn't need to be queried by relays. **Structured JSON data generally shouldn't go in the content field** (kind 0 being an early exception).

#### Guidelines

- **Use content for**: Large text, freeform human-readable content, or existing industry-standard JSON formats (Tiled maps, FHIR, GeoJSON)
- **Use tags for**: Queryable metadata, structured data, anything that needs relay-level filtering
- **Empty content is valid**: Many events need only tags with `content: ""`
- **Relays only index tags**: If you need to filter by a field, it must be a tag

#### Example

**✅ Good - queryable data in tags:**
```json
{
  "kind": 30402,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [["d", "product-123"], ["title", "Camera"], ["price", "250"], ["t", "photography"]]
}
```

**❌ Bad - structured data in content:**
```json
{
  "kind": 30402,
  "content": "{\"title\":\"Camera\",\"price\":250,\"category\":\"photo\"}",
  "tags": [["d", "product-123"]]
}
```

### NIP.md

The file `NIP.md` is used by this project to define a custom Nostr protocol document. If the file doesn't exist, it means this project doesn't have any custom kinds associated with it.

Whenever new kinds are generated, the `NIP.md` file in the project must be created or updated to document the custom event schema. Whenever the schema of one of these custom events changes, `NIP.md` must also be updated accordingly.

### The `useNostr` Hook

The `useNostr` hook returns an object containing a `nostr` property, with `.query()` and `.event()` methods for querying and publishing Nostr events respectively.

```typescript
import { useNostr } from '@nostrify/react';

function useCustomHook() {
  const { nostr } = useNostr();

  // ...
}
```

### Query Nostr Data with `useNostr` and Tanstack Query

When querying Nostr, the best practice is to create custom hooks that combine `useNostr` and `useQuery` to get the required data.

```typescript
import { useNostr } from '@nostrify/react';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/query';

function usePosts() {
  const { nostr } = useNostr();

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['posts'],
    queryFn: async (c) => {
      const signal = AbortSignal.any([c.signal, AbortSignal.timeout(1500)]);
      const events = await nostr.query([{ kinds: [1], limit: 20 }], { signal });
      return events; // these events could be transformed into another format
    },
  });
}
```

#### Efficient Query Design

**Critical**: Always minimize the number of separate queries to avoid rate limiting and improve performance. Combine related queries whenever possible.

**✅ Efficient - Single query with multiple kinds:**
```typescript
// Query multiple event types in one request
const events = await nostr.query([
  {
    kinds: [1, 6, 16], // All repost kinds in one query
    '#e': [eventId],
    limit: 150,
  }
], { signal });

// Separate by type in JavaScript
const notes = events.filter((e) => e.kind === 1);
const reposts = events.filter((e) => e.kind === 6);
const genericReposts = events.filter((e) => e.kind === 16);
```

**❌ Inefficient - Multiple separate queries:**
```typescript
// This creates unnecessary load and can trigger rate limiting
const [notes, reposts, genericReposts] = await Promise.all([
  nostr.query([{ kinds: [1], '#e': [eventId] }], { signal }),
  nostr.query([{ kinds: [6], '#e': [eventId] }], { signal }),
  nostr.query([{ kinds: [16], '#e': [eventId] }], { signal }),
]);
```

**Query Optimization Guidelines:**
1. **Combine kinds**: Use `kinds: [1, 6, 16]` instead of separate queries
2. **Use multiple filters**: When you need different tag filters, use multiple filter objects in a single query
3. **Adjust limits**: When combining queries, increase the limit appropriately
4. **Filter in JavaScript**: Separate event types after receiving results rather than making multiple requests
5. **Consider relay capacity**: Each query consumes relay resources and may count against rate limits

The data may be transformed into a more appropriate format if needed, and multiple calls to `nostr.query()` may be made in a single queryFn.

#### Event Validation

When querying events, if the event kind being returned has required tags or required JSON fields in the content, the events should be filtered through a validator function. This is not generally needed for kinds such as 1, where all tags are optional and the content is freeform text, but is especially useful for custom kinds as well as kinds with strict requirements.

```typescript
// Example validator function for NIP-52 calendar events
function validateCalendarEvent(event: NostrEvent): boolean {
  // Check if it's a calendar event kind
  if (![31922, 31923].includes(event.kind)) return false;

  // Check for required tags according to NIP-52
  const d = event.tags.find(([name]) => name === 'd')?.[1];
  const title = event.tags.find(([name]) => name === 'title')?.[1];
  const start = event.tags.find(([name]) => name === 'start')?.[1];

  // All calendar events require 'd', 'title', and 'start' tags
  if (!d || !title || !start) return false;

  // Additional validation for date-based events (kind 31922)
  if (event.kind === 31922) {
    // start tag should be in YYYY-MM-DD format for date-based events
    const dateRegex = /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/;
    if (!dateRegex.test(start)) return false;
  }

  // Additional validation for time-based events (kind 31923)
  if (event.kind === 31923) {
    // start tag should be a unix timestamp for time-based events
    const timestamp = parseInt(start);
    if (isNaN(timestamp) || timestamp <= 0) return false;
  }

  return true;
}

function useCalendarEvents() {
  const { nostr } = useNostr();

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['calendar-events'],
    queryFn: async (c) => {
      const signal = AbortSignal.any([c.signal, AbortSignal.timeout(1500)]);
      const events = await nostr.query([{ kinds: [31922, 31923], limit: 20 }], { signal });

      // Filter events through validator to ensure they meet NIP-52 requirements
      return events.filter(validateCalendarEvent);
    },
  });
}
```

### The `useAuthor` Hook

To display profile data for a user by their Nostr pubkey (such as an event author), use the `useAuthor` hook.

```tsx
import type { NostrEvent, NostrMetadata } from '@nostrify/nostrify';
import { useAuthor } from '@/hooks/useAuthor';
import { genUserName } from '@/lib/genUserName';

function Post({ event }: { event: NostrEvent }) {
  const author = useAuthor(event.pubkey);
  const metadata: NostrMetadata | undefined = author.data?.metadata;

  const displayName = metadata?.name ?? genUserName(event.pubkey);
  const profileImage = metadata?.picture;

  // ...render elements with this data
}
```

#### `NostrMetadata` type

```ts
/** Kind 0 metadata. */
interface NostrMetadata {
  /** A short description of the user. */
  about?: string;
  /** A URL to a wide (~1024x768) picture to be optionally displayed in the background of a profile screen. */
  banner?: string;
  /** A boolean to clarify that the content is entirely or partially the result of automation, such as with chatbots or newsfeeds. */
  bot?: boolean;
  /** An alternative, bigger name with richer characters than `name`. `name` should always be set regardless of the presence of `display_name` in the metadata. */
  display_name?: string;
  /** A bech32 lightning address according to NIP-57 and LNURL specifications. */
  lud06?: string;
  /** An email-like lightning address according to NIP-57 and LNURL specifications. */
  lud16?: string;
  /** A short name to be displayed for the user. */
  name?: string;
  /** An email-like Nostr address according to NIP-05. */
  nip05?: string;
  /** A URL to the user's avatar. */
  picture?: string;
  /** A web URL related in any way to the event author. */
  website?: string;
}
```

### The `useNostrPublish` Hook

To publish events, use the `useNostrPublish` hook in this project. This hook automatically adds a "client" tag to published events.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

import { useCurrentUser } from "@/hooks/useCurrentUser";
import { useNostrPublish } from '@/hooks/useNostrPublish';

export function MyComponent() {
  const [ data, setData] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});

  const { user } = useCurrentUser();
  const { mutate: createEvent } = useNostrPublish();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    createEvent({ kind: 1, content: data.content });
  };

  if (!user) {
    return <span>You must be logged in to use this form.</span>;
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} disabled={!user}>
      {/* ...some input fields */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

The `useCurrentUser` hook should be used to ensure that the user is logged in before they are able to publish Nostr events.

### Nostr Login

To enable login with Nostr, simply use the `LoginArea` component already included in this project.

```tsx
import { LoginArea } from "@/components/auth/LoginArea";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* other components ... */}

      <LoginArea className="max-w-60" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `LoginArea` component handles all the login-related UI and interactions, including displaying login dialogs, sign up functionality, and switching between accounts. It should not be wrapped in any conditional logic.

`LoginArea` displays both "Log in" and "Sign Up" buttons when the user is logged out, and changes to an account switcher once the user is logged in. It is an inline-flex element by default. To make it expand to the width of its container, you can pass a className like `flex` (to make it a block element) or `w-full`. If it is left as inline-flex, it's recommended to set a max width.

### `npub`, `naddr`, and other Nostr addresses

Nostr defines a set of bech32-encoded identifiers in NIP-19. Their prefixes and purposes:

- `npub1`: **public keys** - Just the 32-byte public key, no additional metadata
- `nsec1`: **private keys** - Secret keys (should never be displayed publicly)
- `note1`: **event IDs** - Just the 32-byte event ID (hex), no additional metadata
- `nevent1`: **event pointers** - Event ID plus optional relay hints and author pubkey
- `nprofile1`: **profile pointers** - Public key plus optional relay hints and petname
- `naddr1`: **addressable event coordinates** - For parameterized replaceable events (kind 30000-39999)
- `nrelay1`: **relay references** - Relay URLs (deprecated)

#### Key Differences Between Similar Identifiers

**`note1` vs `nevent1`:**
- `note1`: Contains only the event ID (32 bytes) - specifically for kind:1 events (Short Text Notes) as defined in NIP-10
- `nevent1`: Contains event ID plus optional relay hints and author pubkey - for any event kind
- Use `note1` for simple references to text notes and threads
- Use `nevent1` when you need to include relay hints or author context for any event type

**`npub1` vs `nprofile1`:**
- `npub1`: Contains only the public key (32 bytes)
- `nprofile1`: Contains public key plus optional relay hints and petname
- Use `npub1` for simple user references
- Use `nprofile1` when you need to include relay hints or display name context

#### NIP-19 Routing Implementation

**Critical**: NIP-19 identifiers should be handled at the **root level** of URLs (e.g., `/note1...`, `/npub1...`, `/naddr1...`), NOT nested under paths like `/note/note1...` or `/profile/npub1...`.

This project includes a boilerplate `NIP19Page` component that provides the foundation for handling all NIP-19 identifier types at the root level. The component is configured in the routing system and ready for AI agents to populate with specific functionality.

**How it works:**

1. **Root-Level Route**: The route `/:nip19` in `AppRouter.tsx` catches all NIP-19 identifiers
2. **Automatic Decoding**: The `NIP19Page` component automatically decodes the identifier using `nip19.decode()`
3. **Type-Specific Sections**: Different sections are rendered based on the identifier type:
   - `npub1`/`nprofile1`: Profile section with placeholder for profile view
   - `note1`: Note section with placeholder for kind:1 text note view
   - `nevent1`: Event section with placeholder for any event type view
   - `naddr1`: Addressable event section with placeholder for articles, marketplace items, etc.
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid, vacant, or unsupported identifiers show 404 NotFound page
5. **Ready for Population**: Each section includes comments indicating where AI agents should implement specific functionality

**Example URLs that work automatically:**
- `/npub1abc123...` - User profile (needs implementation)
- `/note1def456...` - Kind:1 text note (needs implementation)
- `/nevent1ghi789...` - Any event with relay hints (needs implementation)
- `/naddr1jkl012...` - Addressable event (needs implementation)

**Features included:**
- Basic NIP-19 identifier decoding and routing
- Type-specific sections for different identifier types
- Error handling for invalid identifiers
- Responsive container structure
- Comments indicating where to implement specific views

**Error handling:**
- Invalid NIP-19 format → 404 NotFound
- Unsupported identifier types (like `nsec1`) → 404 NotFound
- Empty or missing identifiers → 404 NotFound

To implement NIP-19 routing in your Nostr application:

1. **The NIP19Page boilerplate is already created** - populate sections with specific functionality
2. **The route is already configured** in `AppRouter.tsx`
3. **Error handling is built-in** - all edge cases show appropriate 404 responses
4. **Add specific components** for profile views, event displays, etc. as needed

#### Event Type Distinctions

**`note1` identifiers** are specifically for **kind:1 events** (Short Text Notes) as defined in NIP-10: "Text Notes and Threads". These are the basic social media posts in Nostr.

**`nevent1` identifiers** can reference any event kind and include additional metadata like relay hints and author pubkey. Use `nevent1` when:
- The event is not a kind:1 text note
- You need to include relay hints for better discoverability
- You want to include author context

#### Use in Filters

The base Nostr protocol uses hex string identifiers when filtering by event IDs and pubkeys. Nostr filters only accept hex strings.

```ts
// ❌ Wrong: naddr is not decoded
const events = await nostr.query(
  [{ ids: [naddr] }],
  { signal }
);
```

Corrected example:

```ts
// Import nip19 from nostr-tools
import { nip19 } from 'nostr-tools';

// Decode a NIP-19 identifier
const decoded = nip19.decode(value);

// Optional: guard certain types (depending on the use-case)
if (decoded.type !== 'naddr') {
  throw new Error('Unsupported Nostr identifier');
}

// Get the addr object
const naddr = decoded.data;

// ✅ Correct: naddr is expanded into the correct filter
const events = await nostr.query(
  [{
    kinds: [naddr.kind],
    authors: [naddr.pubkey],
    '#d': [naddr.identifier],
  }],
  { signal }
);
```

#### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Always decode NIP-19 identifiers** before using them in queries
2. **Use the appropriate identifier type** based on your needs:
   - Use `note1` for kind:1 text notes specifically
   - Use `nevent1` when including relay hints or for non-kind:1 events
   - Use `naddr1` for addressable events (always includes author pubkey for security)
3. **Handle different identifier types** appropriately:
   - `npub1`/`nprofile1`: Display user profiles
   - `note1`: Display kind:1 text notes specifically
   - `nevent1`: Display any event with optional relay context
   - `naddr1`: Display addressable events (articles, marketplace items, etc.)
4. **Security considerations**: Always use `naddr1` for addressable events instead of just the `d` tag value, as `naddr1` contains the author pubkey needed to create secure filters
5. **Error handling**: Gracefully handle invalid or unsupported NIP-19 identifiers with 404 responses

### Nostr Edit Profile

To include an Edit Profile form, place the `EditProfileForm` component in the project:

```tsx
import { EditProfileForm } from "@/components/EditProfileForm";

function EditProfilePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* you may want to wrap this in a layout or include other components depending on the project ... */}

      <EditProfileForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `EditProfileForm` component displays just the form. It requires no props, and will "just work" automatically.

### Uploading Files on Nostr

Use the `useUploadFile` hook to upload files. This hook uses Blossom servers for file storage and returns NIP-94 compatible tags.

```tsx
import { useUploadFile } from "@/hooks/useUploadFile";

function MyComponent() {
  const { mutateAsync: uploadFile, isPending: isUploading } = useUploadFile();

  const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
    try {
      // Provides an array of NIP-94 compatible tags
      // The first tag in the array contains the URL
      const [[_, url]] = await uploadFile(file);
      // ...use the url
    } catch (error) {
      // ...handle errors
    }
  };

  // ...rest of component
}
```

To attach files to kind 1 events, each file's URL should be appended to the event's `content`, and an `imeta` tag should be added for each file. For kind 0 events, the URL by itself can be used in relevant fields of the JSON content.

### Nostr Encryption and Decryption

The logged-in user has a `signer` object (matching the NIP-07 signer interface) that can be used for encryption and decryption. The signer's nip44 methods handle all cryptographic operations internally, including key derivation and conversation key management, so you never need direct access to private keys. Always use the signer interface for encryption rather than requesting private keys from users, as this maintains security and follows best practices.

```ts
// Get the current user
const { user } = useCurrentUser();

// Optional guard to check that nip44 is available
if (!user.signer.nip44) {
  throw new Error("Please upgrade your signer extension to a version that supports NIP-44 encryption");
}

// Encrypt message to self
const encrypted = await user.signer.nip44.encrypt(user.pubkey, "hello world");
// Decrypt message to self
const decrypted = await user.signer.nip44.decrypt(user.pubkey, encrypted) // "hello world"
```

### Rendering Rich Text Content

Nostr text notes (kind 1, 11, and 1111) have a plaintext `content` field that may contain URLs, hashtags, and Nostr URIs. These events should render their content using the `NoteContent` component:

```tsx
import { NoteContent } from "@/components/NoteContent";

export function Post(/* ...props */) {
  // ...

  return (
    <CardContent className="pb-2">
      <div className="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
        <NoteContent event={post} className="text-sm" />
      </div>
    </CardContent>
  );
}
```

### Adding Comments Sections

The project includes a complete commenting system using NIP-22 (kind 1111) comments that can be added to any Nostr event or URL. The `CommentsSection` component provides a full-featured commenting interface with threaded replies, user authentication, and real-time updates.

#### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { CommentsSection } from "@/components/comments/CommentsSection";

function ArticlePage({ article }: { article: NostrEvent }) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Your article content */}
      <div>{/* article content */}</div>

      {/* Comments section */}
      <CommentsSection root={article} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Props and Customization

The `CommentsSection` component accepts the following props:

- **`root`** (required): The root event or URL to comment on. Can be a `NostrEvent` or `URL` object.
- **`title`**: Custom title for the comments section (default: "Comments")
- **`emptyStateMessage`**: Message shown when no comments exist (default: "No comments yet")
- **`emptyStateSubtitle`**: Subtitle for empty state (default: "Be the first to share your thoughts!")
- **`className`**: Additional CSS classes for styling
- **`limit`**: Maximum number of comments to load (default: 500)

```tsx
<CommentsSection
  root={event}
  title="Discussion"
  emptyStateMessage="Start the conversation"
  emptyStateSubtitle="Share your thoughts about this post"
  className="mt-8"
  limit={100}
/>
```

#### Commenting on URLs

The comments system also supports commenting on external URLs, making it useful for web pages, articles, or any online content:

```tsx
<CommentsSection
  root={new URL("https://example.com/article")}
  title="Comments on this article"
/>
```

## App Configuration

The project includes an `AppProvider` that manages global application state including theme and relay configuration. The default configuration includes:

```typescript
const defaultConfig: AppConfig = {
  theme: "light",
  relayUrl: "wss://relay.nostr.band",
};
```

Preset relays are available including Ditto, Nostr.Band, Damus, and Primal. The app uses local storage to persist user preferences.

## Routing

The project uses React Router with a centralized routing configuration in `AppRouter.tsx`. To add new routes:

1. Create your page component in `/src/pages/`
2. Import it in `AppRouter.tsx`
3. Add the route above the catch-all `*` route:

```tsx
<Route path="/your-path" element={<YourComponent />} />
```

The router includes automatic scroll-to-top functionality and a 404 NotFound page for unmatched routes.

## Development Practices

- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Follows shadcn/ui component patterns
- Implements Path Aliases with `@/` prefix for cleaner imports
- Uses Vite for fast development and production builds
- Component-based architecture with React hooks
- Default connection to one Nostr relay for best performance
- Comprehensive provider setup with NostrLoginProvider, QueryClientProvider, and custom AppProvider
- **Never use the `any` type**: Always use proper TypeScript types for type safety

## Loading States

**Use skeleton loading** for structured content (feeds, profiles, forms). **Use spinners** only for buttons or short operations.

```tsx
// Skeleton example matching component structure
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
      <Skeleton className="h-10 w-10 rounded-full" />
      <div className="space-y-1">
        <Skeleton className="h-4 w-24" />
        <Skeleton className="h-3 w-16" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <Skeleton className="h-4 w-full" />
      <Skeleton className="h-4 w-4/5" />
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Empty States and No Content Found

When no content is found (empty search results, no data available, etc.), display a minimalist empty state with the `RelaySelector` component. This allows users to easily switch relays to discover content from different sources.

```tsx
import { RelaySelector } from '@/components/RelaySelector';
import { Card, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card';

// Empty state example
<div className="col-span-full">
  <Card className="border-dashed">
    <CardContent className="py-12 px-8 text-center">
      <div className="max-w-sm mx-auto space-y-6">
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          No results found. Try another relay?
        </p>
        <RelaySelector className="w-full" />
      </div>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</div>
```

## Design Customization

**Tailor the site's look and feel based on the user's specific request.** This includes:

- **Color schemes**: Incorporate the user's color preferences when specified, and choose an appropriate scheme that matches the application's purpose and aesthetic
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that match the requested aesthetic (modern, elegant, playful, etc.)
- **Layout**: Follow the requested structure (3-column, sidebar, grid, etc.)
- **Component styling**: Use appropriate border radius, shadows, and spacing for the desired feel
- **Interactive elements**: Style buttons, forms, and hover states to match the theme

### Adding Fonts

To add custom fonts, follow these steps:

1. **Install a font package** using the `js-dev__npm_add_package` tool:

   **Any Google Font can be installed** using the @fontsource packages. Examples:
   - For Inter Variable: `js-dev__npm_add_package({ name: "@fontsource-variable/inter" })`
   - For Roboto: `js-dev__npm_add_package({ name: "@fontsource/roboto" })`
   - For Outfit Variable: `js-dev__npm_add_package({ name: "@fontsource-variable/outfit" })`
   - For Poppins: `js-dev__npm_add_package({ name: "@fontsource/poppins" })`
   - For Open Sans: `js-dev__npm_add_package({ name: "@fontsource/open-sans" })`

   **Format**: `@fontsource/[font-name]` or `@fontsource-variable/[font-name]` (for variable fonts)

2. **Import the font** in `src/main.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import '@fontsource-variable/<font-name>';
   ```

3. **Update Tailwind configuration** in `tailwind.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export default {
     theme: {
       extend: {
         fontFamily: {
           sans: ['Inter Variable', 'Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
         },
       },
     },
   }
   ```

### Recommended Font Choices by Use Case

- **Modern/Clean**: Inter Variable, Outfit Variable, or Manrope
- **Professional/Corporate**: Roboto, Open Sans, or Source Sans Pro
- **Creative/Artistic**: Poppins, Nunito, or Comfortaa
- **Technical/Code**: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or Source Code Pro (for monospace)

### Theme System

The project includes a complete light/dark theme system using CSS custom properties. The theme can be controlled via:

- `useTheme` hook for programmatic theme switching
- CSS custom properties defined in `src/index.css`
- Automatic dark mode support with `.dark` class

### Color Scheme Implementation

When users specify color schemes:
- Update CSS custom properties in `src/index.css` (both `:root` and `.dark` selectors)
- Use Tailwind's color palette or define custom colors
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Apply colors consistently across components (buttons, links, accents)
- Test both light and dark mode variants

### Component Styling Patterns

- Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for component variants
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Add hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Writing Tests vs Running Tests

There is an important distinction between **writing new tests** and **running existing tests**:

### Writing Tests (Creating New Test Files)
**Do not write tests** unless the user explicitly requests them in plain language. Writing unnecessary tests wastes significant time and money. Only create tests when:

1. **The user explicitly asks for tests** to be written in their message
2. **The user describes a specific bug in plain language** and requests tests to help diagnose it
3. **The user says they are still experiencing a problem** that you have already attempted to solve (tests can help verify the fix)

**Never write tests because:**
- Tool results show test failures (these are not user requests)
- You think tests would be helpful
- New features or components are created
- Existing functionality needs verification

### Running Tests (Executing the Test Suite)
**ALWAYS run the test script** after making any code changes. This is mandatory regardless of whether you wrote new tests or not.

- **You must run the test script** using `js-dev__run_script` tool with the "test" parameter
- **Your task is not complete** until the test script passes without errors
- **This applies to all changes** - bug fixes, new features, refactoring, or any code modifications
- **The test script includes** TypeScript compilation, ESLint checks, and existing test validation

### Test Setup

The project uses Vitest with jsdom environment and includes comprehensive test setup:

- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library with jest-dom matchers
- **Test Environment**: jsdom with mocked browser APIs (matchMedia, scrollTo, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)
- **Test App**: `TestApp` component provides all necessary context providers for testing

The project includes a `TestApp` component that provides all necessary context providers for testing. Wrap components with this component to provide required context providers:

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { TestApp } from '@/test/TestApp';
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(
      <TestApp>
        <MyComponent />
      </TestApp>
    );

    expect(screen.getByText('Expected text')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Testing Your Changes

**CRITICAL**: Whenever you are finished modifying code, you must run the **test** script using the **js-dev__run_script** tool.

**Your task is not considered finished until this test passes without errors.**

**This requirement applies regardless of whether you wrote new tests or not.** The test script validates the entire codebase, including TypeScript compilation, ESLint rules, and existing test suite.
